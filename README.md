# Signal-detection-with-dynamic-programming
The scripts can be used to reproduce the experiments presented in our paper: Signal detection with dynamic programming, coauthored by Mordechai Roth, Amichai Painsky, and Tamir Bendory.
There are five main Matlab files.
1. Well_separated_setup: 
This script reproduces the data and figures for the experiments in subsections A,B and C of the numerical experiment section for well separated setups. 
2. Arbitrary_spacing_experiment:
This script reproduces the data and figures for the experiments in subsections A,B and C of the numerical experiment section for arbitrary spaces setups.
3. gap_statistic_experiment:
This script reproduces the data and figures for the experiments in subsection B of the numerical experiment section for arbitrary spaces setups.
4. Measurement_length_experiment:
This script reproduces the data and figures for the experiments in subsection D of the numerical experiment section.
5. Super_resolution_experiment:
This script reproduces the data and figures for the experiments in subsection E of the numerical experiment section.
